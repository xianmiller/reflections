What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
1. git creates the framework for tracking the content in the repository.
2. we need to do it in order to correctly commit files into the repository when needed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
1. the staging area is an intermediary between the working diretory and the repository
2. it allows the user to specifically designate which files to commit (or not) prior to actually committing the files to the repository.
